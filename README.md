# tvipsBlo
This code aims to convert Tvips - 4DSTEM data to BLO file.  The most important thing for the conversion process is to find the first frame where the 4DSTEM data acquisition starts.  Step 1 provides an automated way to find such a frame. This automated method works for the data set that has a significant change in the content of the diffraction frames before and after the start of the scan, otherwise manual selection by checking individual diffraction parts is also supported in this code.  Step 2 generates a section of the virtual brightfield image to confirm that the user finds the correct frame at which the scan starts.  Step 3 performs the conversion of the data set from the Tvips file to the BLO file. Batch conversion is supported.  Requirement: This script has been tested on Python 3.7.3. Please pip install any packages that are missing on your computer.
